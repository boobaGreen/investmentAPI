## 📍 Overview

**Exercise Specifications:**

A company has decided to allow frontend-enabling bees to the public
developers to experiment with those already made bees. Bees will allow you to create and
read about investments and an API that allows you to see how many and which ones over time
investments have been made. However, before carrying out some operations they must be
authorizations via a specific API, which will assign two levels of access based on the request

**Technical specifications:**

1. Create an API that returns a unique, one-time use code
   which provides access to the rest of the bees with two permission levels, one for
   reading and one for reading and writing. If the request is made a basic
   permission to grant that reading and writing otherwise only in
   reading
2. Creation of investments
3. Reading investments
4. Investment statistics API, which allows you to filter between two periods to see the
   number or value of investments made in the selected period. Furthermore
   this api will have to be used for graphs, consequently the values
   they can be divided by day, week, month and year

**Investment Specifications:** {
data creation,
confirmation of data,
value,
annual rate,
id
}

**Delivery specifications:**
The code must be delivered via a public repository on github, with the
specifications to start in code.
It is advisable to leave Postman (or similar) files in the repository for API testing

**Implementation Requests:**

- Backend development must be implemented with Node.js and a framework
  choice(Express favorite)
- The use of Typescript is mandatory
- Data can be saved in a SQL db or in a file
- Carry out e2e tests to verify the correct functioning of the developed APIs
  (with bookcase of your choice)

**Evaluation methods:**
The project will be evaluated based on:

- Code quality and reusability
- Compliance with requirements
- Following best practices
- Correct use of git

## 📦 Features

### Investment Management

- **Creation:** Allows the creation of new investments by specifying value and annual interest rate.
- **Reading:** Enables viewing all investments, a single investment, or aggregate statistics over a defined period.
- **Update:** Allows modification of an existing investment's details (value, interest rate, confirmation date).
- **Deletion:** Enables the removal of an investment.

### Authentication

- **JWT Token:** Uses JWT tokens to authenticate users and secure resources. The token is unique and can be used only once.
- **User Roles:** Supports different user roles : read, readWrite for athl level permission.

### Statistics

- **Data Analysis:** Provides features to analyze investment data, such as performance over time .
- **Customization:** Allows users to customize statistics according to their needs, including selecting the relevant period and choosing the granularity between day, week, month, and year.

### Other Features

- **Health Check:** Monitors the server's health status.
- **API Documentation:** Provides detailed documentation of the APIs.

## 🔥 API

### Get Authorization Token

- **Method:** GET
- **Path:** `/api/authorization/`

- **Authentication:**
  - None: Results in read-only token
  - Basic Auth: Results in read-write token
- **Response:** JWT token

### Get All Investments

- **Method:** GET
- **Path:** `/api/investments/`
- **Description:** Returns a list of all investments.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**_Requirements_**

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- **TypeScript**: `version x.y.z`

### ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js (>= 22.2.0) installed locally .
Useful links:

- Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager

### Main Installation

1. Clone the investmentAPI repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/boobaGreen/investmentAPI
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```sh
cd investmentAPI
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

4. Create the .env files. For the project, we plan to create 2 databases, one for 'dev' and one for 'test'. To keep the two environments separate, I have prepared scripts to facilitate their creation and initial seeding.
   he main environment file is called .env, while the one for testing is .env.test. I have provided two example files for reference: .env.example and .env.test.example

5. Now let's create the 2 databases with this commands :

```sh
npm run dbdev:push
```

```sh
npm run dbtest:push
```

6. Populate them with sample records if necessary using seed data :

```sh
npm run dbdev:seed
```

```sh
npm run dbtest:seed
```

### 🤖 Running investmentAPI

#### Local Run

Use the following command to run investmentAPI with nodeman:

```sh
npm run dev
```

#### Deploy - for Production

Use the following command to build:

```sh
npm run build
```

Use the following command to run:

```sh
npm start
```

### 🧪 Tests

#### Jest e SuperTest:

The project includes a comprehensive suite of automated tests utilizing Jest and Supertest. These tests cover various aspects of the application, including end-to-end (E2E) scenarios and critical sections of the codebase.

- **Unit Tests**: Ensures individual components and functions work as expected.
- **Integration Tests**: Verifies that different parts of the application work together correctly.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Simulates real user scenarios to test the application in a production-like environment.

All major functionalities and code paths have been covered by these tests. However, additional tests can be added to cover more specific cases or edge scenarios as needed.

To run the tests, use the following commands:

- `npm test` - for running all the unit and integration tests.

```sh
npm run test
```

#### Postman

#### Insomnia
